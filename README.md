> [!NOTE]
> - Everything is stored locally, so if you switch devices you will lose all your comics/folders, but on the plus size you don't have to create an account and is fast (plan on working on a token system in the future so you can send your data to other devices).
> - For now it only supports Marvel comics, since DC doesn't have an API.
> - I plan on adding more quality of life features, animations and general improvements in the future.

> [!CAUTION]
> - Some responsiveness issues might still exists. I recommend using the modal in fullscreen.
